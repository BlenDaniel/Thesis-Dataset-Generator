This PR is a first step to more advanced S3 operators.
The hook can currently check for buckets, prefixes and keys,
and will parse boto, AWS sdks or s3cmd config files if they
are defined in the connection in the Airflow connection db.

The sensor uses the Hook to check for a particular file
(or key to follow amazon's nomenclature). I also added wrappers
for boto methods to list keys and prefixes.

,"Make sure Executors properly trap errors

SequentialExecutor and LocalExecutor execute `airflow run` commands
with `subprocess.Popen().wait()` and try to catch errors with
`try/except`. However, `subprocess.Popen()` doesn't raise errors;
you have to check the `returncode`. As a result, these Executors
always report that their commands are successful. This is normally fine
because task status gets precedence over executor status, so as long
as the task reports on itself correctly the issue is avoided. But
if an error is raised BEFORE a task runs -- meaning the task is not
yet monitoring its own status -- then the executor will incorrectly
report success. Airflow will actually notice something went wrong,
but because the task doesn't say it failed, it gets rescheduled,
leading to an infinite loop.

To resolve this, replace the Executor's `Popen().wait()` with
`check_call()`, which is a blocking method that raises an error
if the returncode != 0. This way, errors are properly recognized.

Also, prevent infinite loops by limiting the number of times a
task is allowed to be rescheduled due to executor failure to 3.
(Note: this doesn't affect the number of times a task can be
rescheduled due to its own failure).

Last, check for an odd situation where the executor reports failure
but the task reports running.

,"Check name of SubDag class instead of class itself

`airflow.operators.SubDagOperator` and
`airflow.operators.subdag_operator.SubDagOperator` are NOT the

if a task is in fact a SubDagOperator. This is because of Airflow's
import machinery. It is *probably* ok to check both classes with
`isinstance()` but the behavior is surprising and to cover our bases
we check for __class__.__name__ and a `subdag` attr.

A task’s try_number is unbounded (incremented by 1 on every run) so
it needs to be adjusted both for logging and for seeing if a task
has eclipsed the retry cap. Rerunning a task (either because it
failed or with the `force` option) not only leads to nonsensical
error messages (“Attempt 2 of 1”) but also would never kick off a
retry attempt (because try_number > retries). The solution is to mod
the `try_number` with `retries` to keep everything sensible.

not logged)

,"Fix logic for determining DagRun states

Previously, DagRuns failed if any task failed and succeeded if all
tasks succeeded or were skipped. However, because of trigger behaviors,
that’s not right — a task can fail and another task can start up with
an “on failed” trigger.

This changes the logic to consider three termination cases:

1. Failure. If any of the root tasks fail, the dagrun fails. This is
because there is no possibility of any “on failure” trigger coming off
a root task.

2. Success. If ALL of the root nodes succeed or skip, the dagrun
succeeds. This means there can be upstream failures as long as failure
triggers are respected.

3. Deadlock — A dag run is deadlocked when no action is possible.
This is determined by the presence of unfinished tasks without met
dependencies. However, care must be taken when depends_on_past=True
because individual dag runs could *look* like they are deadlocked
when they are actually just waiting for earlier runs to finish.

To solve this problem, we evaluate deadlocks in two ways. First,
across all dagruns simultaneously (to account for situations with
depends_on_past=True). Second, in each individual dagrun (but only
if there are no depends_on_past relationship).",Bug fixes

managed by traditional unix systems services like rc.d / upstart / systemd
and the likes. This patch adds the ""--pid"" flag. By default it stores the
PID in ~/airflow/airflow-<service>.pid

Lastly, the patch adds support for different log file locations: log,
stdout, and stderr (respectively: --log-file, --stdout, --stderr). By
default these are stored in ~/airflow/airflow-<service>.log/out/err.

,"Add DAG inference, deferral, and context manager

- Operators can be created without DAGs, but the DAG can be added at
any time thereafter (by assigning to the ‘dag’ attribute). Once a DAG
is assigned, it can not be removed or reassigned.

- Operators can infer DAGs from other operators. Setting a relationship
will also set the DAG, if possible. Operators from different DAGs and
operators with no DAGs can not be chained.

- DAGs can be used as context managers. When “inside” a DAG context
manager, the default DAG for all new Operators is that DAG (unless they
specify a different one)

- Unit tests

- Add default owner for Operators

- Support composing operators with >> and <<

Three special cases:
  op1 >> op2 is equivalent to op.set_downstream(op2)
  op1 << op2 is equivalent to op1.set_upstream(op2)
  dag >> op1 (in any order or direction) means op1.dag = dag

,"Partial fix to make sure next_run_date cannot be None

It seems possible that a TaskInstance has not yet been inserted for the first run.
As a result, even though last_scheduled_run is None, then latest_run is also None.
If latest_run is None, then the logic above picks the min start date for all of the
tasks in the dag. This should never be None -- this is where there might be a bug.

This patch works around the issue by making sure a next_run_date is always set to
either the dag start date if the TaskInstance has no calculated next_run_date yet.",Bug fixes
,"Add multiprocessing support to the scheduler

As the amount of dags grows and the ability to create dags programmatically
is more often used, more and more time is spend in the scheduler which lowers
throughput.

This patch adds the ability to use multiple threads to the scheduler. The
amount of threads can be specified by ""max_threads"" in the scheduler section
of the configuration. The amount of threads will, however, not exceed the
amount of cores.

,"Optimize and refactor process_dag

This patch addresses the following issues:
get_active_runs was a getter that was also updating
to the database. This patch refactors get_active_runs
into two different functions that are part of DagRun.
update_state update state of the dagrun based on the
taskinstances of the dagrun. verify_integrity checks
and updates the dag run based on if the dag contains
new or missing tasks.

Deadlock detection has been refactored to ensure that
database does not get hit twice, in some circumstances
this can reduce the time spent by 50%.

process_dag has been refactored to use the functions
of DagRun reducing complexity and reducing pressure on the
database. In addition locking is now properly working
under the assumption that the heartrate is longer
than the time process_dag spends.

Two new TaskInstance states have been introduced. ""REMOVED""
and ""SCHEDULED"". REMOVED will be set when taskinstances
are encountered that do no exist anymore in the DAG.
This happens when a DAG is changed (ie. a new version).
The ""REMOVED"" state exists for lineage purposes.
""SCHEDULED"" is used when a Task that did not have a state
before is sent to the executor. It is used by both the
scheduler and backfills. This state almost removes the
race condition that exists if using multiple schedulers:
due to the fact UP_FOR_RETRY is being managed by the
TaskInstance (I think that is the wrong place) is still
exists for that state.",Feature requests or new feature

,"[Airflow-2202] Add filter support in HiveMetastoreHook().max_partition()

Adding back support for filter in max_partition()
which could be used by some valid use cases. It
will work for tables with multiple partitions,
which is the behavior before (tho the doc stated
it only works for single partitioned table). This
change also kept the behavior when trying to get
max partition on a sub-partitioned table without
supplying filter--it will return the max partition
value of the partition key even it is not unique.

Some extra checks are added to provide more
meaningful exception messages.

,"[Airflow-1413] Fix FTPSensor failing on error message with unexpected text. (#2450)

* [AIRFLOW-1413] Fix FTPSensor file presence check

Currently FTPSensor operates by checking text of error
message returned from ftp lib. It only succeeds if the
message matches the expected text. Otherwise it fails
with an exception. However the message is dependend
on a system, locale and possibly other factors.

This patch changes the operation to inspect error code
rather than message text.

It also adds option to ignore certain classes of errors
such as Host Unavailable that are recoverable, thus the
performed action can and should be retried according
to ftp spec.
