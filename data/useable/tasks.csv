This PR is a first step to more advanced S3 operators.
The hook can currently check for buckets, prefixes and keys,

are defined in the connection in the Airflow connection db.

The sensor uses the Hook to check for a particular file
(or key to follow amazon's nomenclature). I also added wrappers
for boto methods to list keys and prefixes.

,"Only use multipart upload in S3Hook if file is large enough

Prior to this change, uploads would fail if the target file was larger than the specified multipart_bytes value. This is problematic when you're handling files that can vary in size. It makes sense to handle this inside the hook rather than forcing the user to manage this. Now S3Hook.load_file will automatically detect whether or not the file is large enough to qualify for multibyte uploads and use the appropriate method. Also added a default of 5GB for multipart_bytes. This value makes sense because S3 will automatically fail when uploading files larger than this unless multipart uploads are used.",

,"Make sure Executors properly trap errors

SequentialExecutor and LocalExecutor execute `airflow run` commands
with `subprocess.Popen().wait()` and try to catch errors with
`try/except`. However, `subprocess.Popen()` doesn't raise errors;
you have to check the `returncode`. As a result, these Executors
always report that their commands are successful. This is normally fine
because task status gets precedence over executor status, so as long
as the task reports on itself correctly the issue is avoided. But
if an error is raised BEFORE a task runs -- meaning the task is not
yet monitoring its own status -- then the executor will incorrectly
report success. Airflow will actually notice something went wrong,
but because the task doesn't say it failed, it gets rescheduled,
leading to an infinite loop.

To resolve this, replace the Executor's `Popen().wait()` with
`check_call()`, which is a blocking method that raises an error
if the returncode != 0. This way, errors are properly recognized.

Also, prevent infinite loops by limiting the number of times a
task is allowed to be rescheduled due to executor failure to 3.
(Note: this doesn't affect the number of times a task can be
rescheduled due to its own failure).

Last, check for an odd situation where the executor reports failure
but the task reports running.

Closes #1199
See #1220 for a test case",
,Update Airflow docs for remote logging,
,"Check name of SubDag class instead of class itself

`airflow.operators.SubDagOperator` and
`airflow.operators.subdag_operator.SubDagOperator` are NOT the
same. Airflow needs to check against both classes to determine
if a task is in fact a SubDagOperator. This is because of Airflow's
import machinery. It is *probably* ok to check both classes with
`isinstance()` but the behavior is surprising and to cover our bases
we check for __class__.__name__ and a `subdag` attr.

closes #1168",
,Add wiki link to README.md,
,"Add function to get configuration as dict, plus unit tests

There are many ways to set configuration options in Airflow
but no way to actually see all of them (the web UI only shows
airflow.cfg). This takes the current configuration object
and writes it to a dict.

The ""source"" of an option can be displayed (for example,
'airflow.cfg', 'default', 'env var', etc.).

Sensitive (confidential) configuration options can be included
Unless specified, they are censored as '< hidden >'.",
,"Properly measure number of task retry attempts

A task’s try_number is unbounded (incremented by 1 on every run) so
it needs to be adjusted both for logging and for seeing if a task
has eclipsed the retry cap. Rerunning a task (either because it
failed or with the `force` option) not only leads to nonsensical
error messages (“Attempt 2 of 1”) but also would never kick off a
retry attempt (because try_number > retries). The solution is to mod
the `try_number` with `retries` to keep everything sensible.

Fixed: use the correct attempt number when logging
Fixed: log when tasks are queued (log message was being created but
not logged)
Fixed: situation where tasks being run after the first time would
not be put up for retry",
,"Refactoring utils into smaller submodules

utils.py had become a little too complex. Other projects like

thematically. I rebased off of master and fixed references across

The current machinery for running BackfillJobs overrides tasks’

critically, doesn’t always carry through all of the nested Jobs. We

considering whether a task can be queued.

Also, this will be used later to evaluate whether a set of tasks is
deadlocked.",
,"Improve BackfillJob handling of queued/deadlocked tasks

1. Introduce a concept of a deadlocked backfill, meaning no tasks can
run. The easiest way to create this is with depends_on_past.
Previously, backfill would sit forever. Now it identifies the deadlock
and exist, possibly informing the user that a cause of the deadlock
with depends_on_past

2. Previously, BackfillJob would run a task once to put it in a queue,
but then ignore the queued task on every subsequent loop, resulting in
it never being run. Now it considers queued tasks and runs them.

3. “UP_FOR_RETRY” tasks were not handled properly by the executor (it
raised the “the airflow run command failed at reporting an error”
message). Now they are.",
,"Make SchedulerJob not run EVERY queued task

SchedulerJob loads EVERY queued task and tries to run it, which creates
conflicts with any other Job trying to do the same (BackfillJob from
CLI or subdag, or potentially [one day] other schedulers). This creates
a new method, process_events, which polls the Scheduler’s own executor
for queued tasks and adds them to a set. The scheduler then only
considers that set when prioritizing queued tasks.",
,"Fix logic for determining DagRun states

Previously, DagRuns failed if any task failed and succeeded if all
tasks succeeded or were skipped. However, because of trigger behaviors,
that’s not right — a task can fail and another task can start up with
an “on failed” trigger.

This changes the logic to consider three termination cases:

1. Failure. If any of the root tasks fail, the dagrun fails. This is
because there is no possibility of any “on failure” trigger coming off
a root task.

2. Success. If ALL of the root nodes succeed or skip, the dagrun
succeeds. This means there can be upstream failures as long as failure
triggers are respected.

3. Deadlock — A dag run is deadlocked when no action is possible.
This is determined by the presence of unfinished tasks without met
dependencies. However, care must be taken when depends_on_past=True
because individual dag runs could *look* like they are deadlocked
when they are actually just waiting for earlier runs to finish.

To solve this problem, we evaluate deadlocks in two ways. First,
across all dagruns simultaneously (to account for situations with
depends_on_past=True). Second, in each individual dagrun (but only
if there are no depends_on_past relationship).",

This patch addresses the following issues:
get_active_runs was a getter that was also updating

update_state update state of the dagrun based on the
taskinstances of the dagrun. verify_integrity checks
and updates the dag run based on if the dag contains
new or missing tasks.

Deadlock detection has been refactored to ensure that
database does not get hit twice, in some circumstances
this can reduce the time spent by 50%.

process_dag has been refactored to use the functions
of DagRun reducing complexity and reducing pressure on the
database. In addition locking is now properly working
under the assumption that the heartrate is longer
than the time process_dag spends.

Two new TaskInstance states have been introduced. ""REMOVED""
and ""SCHEDULED"". REMOVED will be set when taskinstances
are encountered that do no exist anymore in the DAG.
This happens when a DAG is changed (ie. a new version).
The ""REMOVED"" state exists for lineage purposes.
""SCHEDULED"" is used when a Task that did not have a state
before is sent to the executor. It is used by both the
scheduler and backfills. This state almost removes the
race condition that exists if using multiple schedulers:
due to the fact UP_FOR_RETRY is being managed by the
TaskInstance (I think that is the wrong place) is still
exists for that state.",

In a backfill one can specify a specific task to
execute. We
create a subset of the orginal tasks in a subdag
from the original dag.
The subdag has the same name as the original dag.
This breaks
the integrity check of a dag_run as tasks are
suddenly not in
scope any more.

Adding back support for filter in max_partition()
which could be used by some valid use cases. It
will work for tables with multiple partitions,
which is the behavior before (tho the doc stated
it only works for single partitioned table). This
change also kept the behavior when trying to get
max partition on a sub-partitioned table without
supplying filter--it will return the max partition
value of the partition key even it is not unique.

Some extra checks are added to provide more
meaningful exception messages.

* [AIRFLOW-1413] Fix FTPSensor file presence check

Currently FTPSensor operates by checking text of error
message returned from ftp lib. It only succeeds if the
message matches the expected text. Otherwise it fails
with an exception. However the message is dependend
on a system, locale and possibly other factors.

This patch changes the operation to inspect error code
rather than message text.

It also adds option to ignore certain classes of errors
such as Host Unavailable that are recoverable, thus the
performed action can and should be retried according
to ftp spec.

* [AIRFLOW-1413] Adjustments as per code review
