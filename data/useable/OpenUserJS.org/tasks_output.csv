Advantages:
* **Works** unlike simple-xss
* Lots of maintainers/contributors
* Smaller than simple-xss
* Correctly allows sanitizing text **first** then applying markdown
* Optional list is included for current defaults... this **can be removed** but I would feel safer matching it in case something comes down the line we don't like.
* Does filter out `javascript:` items just like xss

* Express 3 deprecated this a while back to a separate package. It is currently default used with POST request response so this probably needs to be kept in.

Pkg docs say to use it in intial setup.

* Accessing the datalist should be accomplished by two single clicks *(currently one to focus and one to activate)* with a pointing device, pressing the space bar when nothing has been previously entered, and of course if you already know it just start typing the first part and it should filter the datalist.
* When possibly adding new values try to mirror them into whichever modal datalist with/without a plural value e.g. a repeat offender so usually that User will go away... this won't always be the case and it may eventually veer from this structure a bit.
* *Try not to abuse* a generic reason without elaborating e.g. like spamming.

Second attempt... needed the other boogs fixed first plus found one and missed UI metas

* Use *pegjs* synchronously... I do have a portion of the routine for asynchronous *(done first)* but *(sync)* seems safer in the event of a production failure
* Establish the `OpenUserJS` metadata block and migrate all collaboration there
* Store localized `@name` and `@description`... not currently in use but available
* Some, but not all, line lengths in affected files wrapped according to STYLEGUIDE.md
* If no script description don't create the `p` tag on script lists
* Some stray trailing commas removed
* Some string constants shortened for error messages.. type 400 is Bad Request by standards and we shouldn't need to say that again.
* Some DOC/UI changes to match

**NOTE**: Still needs *mongoose* DB migration otherwise all the meta values used don't show up

* Bumping project version... e.g. once the *mongoose* *(DB data)* migration occurs there is no going back to a prior project version otherwise there will be possible DB corruption/failures *(most notably the meta.js route)* in older commit HEADS

* If for some reason some user is flagged but there aren't any actual flags it will show up as no user and no reason e.g. Flagged column will be empty for those mustache opts
* Using series in some of the *async* related calls to hopefully ensure natural ordered flags

* *npm* is having some controversy regarding distribution terms of non-owned Code and from what it appears is to be modifying FOSS licensing e.g. similar to ""Tivoization"" that happened with GPL 2.x and GPL 3.x fixed... so changing suggestion to a possible update of *npm* versions instead of a recommendation. Ref: nodejs/node#3959
* Latest, and most recent *npm*@3.x, may also have some installation issues so fall back to the `sudo make uninstall` and `sudo make install` if you can't get rid of *npm* via `sudo npm uninstall npm -g` ... ref npm/npm#10492
* We may need to drop/swap-out *npm* if they can't resolve the distinction sufficiently between altering Code licenses with the Client of *npm* versus the Service of npmjs.com from what I gather... but that is currently being discussed upstream at *node*. Related to #249 and \*ughh\*

,"Fix some bugs with encoding

* Remove legacy namespace in all routes ... part of #262 and #130... officially EOL as per sizzle and confirmed by me... no redirects.
* Remove the patches I put in for this portion
* Create function for encoding similar to GH's... see helper `encoding`
* Using encodeURIComponent from #795
* Fix bug of Fork History showing ""slugged"" instead of native/raw
* Fix category reference bug... redirect was set to the Object itself and not one of its properties
* Fix some more missing object identifiers in modelParser.js ... not all are validated yet and some may still be missing for future proofing
* Remove and Add some more watchpoints
* Flip successful ""rating updated"" for Groups to debug mode and related in `./libs/modelParser.js` ... these are generating too much log traffic #430

**NOTES**
* [ ] Followup with DB migration to add `fork.utf` to existing forks otherwise they may not show up next to the bullet
* Leaving GH import alone as it still works so far ... however a watchpoint added... GH web UI always `encodeURIComponent` just about everything... will need to reaffirm existing `encodeURI` later
* The term uri is inclusive to urls as previously described in #819 ... however in this context url means it could be partially encoded whereas uri means it absolutely is encoded... except for the slashes... normally those are encoded but we don't want them encoded... again following GH example. A url containing `ä` may be just that however a uri has `%E4`. You will notice that I renamed some of our identifiers from `url` to `uri`... this is on purpose to indicate that is what we are expecting.
* *express* `redirect()` uses [`Location`](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30) and [`Content-Location`](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.14) headers. This requires all urls to be at least URI encoded as per specs... e.g. all the browsers are adding in an `escape` for the section symbol *which may be an issue with them*. So hence why the naming of `url` vs `uri`.
* The base issue of readability of the code is still there... but at least this punches out some of the bugs mentioned.
* Compression/optimization hasn't occurred yet
* No DB migration is necessary now... this includes fixing `Re:` linkage
* The smarter encoder isn't finished yet as I may be rearranging this a bit but...

**This should knock out the BLOCKING label I put on**... at least from my perspective.

This appear to do exactly what we are looking for without the extra baggage. A little newer to the mix and not semver major yet... but seems stabler. Thanks to and welcome ""the new kid on the block"".

Threw a couple of real IPv6 addresses into the mix and it returned appropriate values:

``` js
ipRangeCheck(
  'FE80::0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329',
  ['192.30.252.0/22', '185.199.108.0/22', '140.82.112.0/20']

* Renamed existing scripts to match their counterpart names e.g.
* `npm run preinstall` ... will get rid of that pesky `package-lock.json` when needed and is run on `npm install` always
* `npm run postinstall`... well probably shouldn't run this directly at all but it's there none-the-less

,"Change symbol (#1474)

* Only ""infinity"", sort of, exists in `interval` mode... each browser treats this differently. Mozilla based browsers, for example, sets to end of session. Chromium based browsers sets to 1 year *(which is too long imho)*. `native` is utilized better with this logical mathematical nomenclature to fit both modes of *connect-mongo*
* The ""Wedge"" symbol in this use is ""ascending"" to the maximum *(again avoiding strings to translate down the line... think of it as pointing towards the ""ceiling"" limit)*. The opposite is ""Vel"" which is `&or` which is ""descending"" or pointing towards the ""floor"" limit. Both are Delta's of finite change instead of infinite change.

,"Invert the TTL value and extend to fixed (#1480)

* Now this is giving predictable results so far.

Refs:
* https://github.com/jdesboeufs/connect-mongo/blob/9f86f90/README.md#session-expiration
* https://github.com/jdesboeufs/connect-mongo/blob/9f86f90/README.md#remove-expired-sessions

NOTES:
These versions of the docs are ambiguous. The TTL is how often it reaches out to the DB... if it finds an expired session **or** a session cookie it will then remove it. So the inversion of the logic should fix this as it checks every 10ish minutes for expiry as well as session cookies and destroys them. Had a light bulb flip on with `interval` being doc'd at 10 minutes so I thought to try TTL at that... and voila. :)

This theoretically should solve #604 by sticking to this methodology *(until MongoDB changes something heh)*

When available will do some code condensing to reuse some more code if applicable.

* Remove flag UI notice if not able to... this should be in line with comments so they don't accidently/purposely get turned on without establishing owner approval. Modal is still output because of a logic error in what comes first versus the view... probably in the controller as a post op outside of `modelParser`... omitting for now.

,"Tag possible error prone code points (#1564)

* These are mostly comments in this PR
* Normalized a few more identifiers to their standards for easier grep'ing. I'm sure there's more.
* Some of these may be silent as intended... they should be denoted as such... like `fallthrough` for `switch` should be normally
* Some of these assume that AWS S3 and MongoLabs are perfectly connected and no issues... bad idea. This is what I was describing. We need [#37](Graceful failure) whether it's a comment, a console message, a page, or some combination of these.
* This doesn't include MongoDB calls that just use `save()` for example... which is not recommended at all. Error traps are good when connecting to third parties whether they are local or remote. I'm not perfect either but I can get easily burned out on fixing these which is why I work in stages instead of all at once. Don't get paid for that! ;) :) Always fill out the arguments if known especially with `aErr`. That's a reason why it's done first in this coding style.
* This was a very brief skim over the code... hopefully it wasn't overzealous or underzealous in code points... but they are comments to be addressed eventually. Living on four hours of sleep in 3 days isn't good so I'm taking a break not to mention a few days away from holiday days.

,"Point dev to newer hosted DB version (#1567)

* This is very close to production version but since it is shared it's a crap shoot when creating a sandboxed *(free but limited btw)* DB. Interesting feature of mLabs. May try again to see if we can match it. First creation wasn't close enough; 2nd time it is close.

NOTES:
* Will leave old dev db up for a bit until full retesting occurs. Basic seems to be okay with new dev db.
* The FQDN name has changed for dev mLabs at some point in history. Probably offloaded onto a different server is an educated guess via DNS.
* pwd has to be at least 6 characters and include alphanumerics now... making as general as possible
* Can only import exported collections from here. Full DB import from export isn't happy which is okay as long as metadata `_since` is preserved. Probably has to do with db name conflict and mLabs.
* Metadata `_since` is preserved however it did complain about indexes on one collection:

``` console
2019-01-03T16:20:45.014-0700    Failed: openuserjs_devel.scripts: error creating indexes for openuserjs_devel.scripts: createIndex error: The field 'safe' is not valid for an index specification. Specification: { background: true, safe: null, name: ""name_1"", ns: ""openuserjs_devel.scripts"", key: { name: 1 } }
```

* 12 system indexes in new vs old which had 17. From v1 to v2. db name auto-adjusted.
* nodejitsu user index item not inclusive. Talk about a blast from the past.
*  Some misc indexes that I'm not sure why they are there were not auto-imported.
* Btw we are Eastern served... so not quite sure why the traceroute tests were going West other than general internet misdirection at this time in the backbones.
* Btw if we take this info to the VPS we may lose the dev db and probably need to establish additional limited sub-accounts

* Limit a few more things to possibly curtail some 431's
* Ease up on MongoDB having issues with script querying and CPU load. Limit to first copied block of characters in `about`. This amount may get smaller and is currently in flux.
* Create new clipped searchable fields. I spent a lot of time to see if MongoDB/*mongoose* had a limiter on their indexer and couldn't find one so we get to do it manually.

NOTE:
* This will temporarily remove everyone's Summary but it will be manually migrated in the DB in a while. If you are impatient... edit your script *(no changes necessary)* and resave it... that will do the migration also.

* *async*@3.x migration
* Using a more applicable statusCodePage for DB S3 connection issue... the error message is still rather vague since it's abstracted several times between function calls but was tested and landed on 404 during *fakeS3* usage. At some point when all callback signatures can be set to `aErr`, `aResults` this should be more explicit... until then preserving existing vagueness.
* Revert #1599 as Fx still uses this in 68.x. TLSv1 EOL will still prevent Opera Presto from even visiting the site.

NOTES:
* Apparently version 3.x migration is extremely picky now about how Err is generated. i.e. it doesn't allow `true`/`false` anymore like it did in version 2.x. This causes the request to never complete with `async.parallel`. The web spinner and no source is retrieved even though **it was successfully retrieved**.
* Been probing/testing dev manually and it seems to be non-sluggish atm with Fx 68.x... perhaps a change from 3.0 to 3.1 of this dep... or even Chromium report since distro version is/was a bit buggy at the time of testing.
